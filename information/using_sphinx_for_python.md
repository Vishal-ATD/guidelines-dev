# Documentation for Python Codebase

This documentation provides an overview of the Python codebase and its functionality. It includes both API documentation and general information about the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Sphinx: Install Sphinx using pip, the Python package manager:
  ```
  pip install sphinx
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install project dependencies (if any) by following the instructions in the project's README.

3. Generate HTML documentation:
   - Navigate to the `docs` directory:
     ```
     cd your-repo/docs
     ```
   - Run the following command to generate the HTML documentation:
     ```
     make html
     ```
   - The generated HTML files will be located in the `docs/_build/html` directory.

4. Open the generated HTML documentation in a web browser to access the documentation.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is structured as follows:

- **API Documentation:** Provides detailed information about the modules, classes, functions, and methods in the codebase.

- **General Documentation:** Contains general information about the project, its purpose, usage guidelines, and any additional details relevant to understanding and working with the codebase.

## API Documentation

The API documentation covers the various modules and their components present in the codebase. It provides details about classes, functions, and methods along with their parameters, return types, and usage.

To access the API documentation:

1. Open the generated HTML documentation in a web browser.
2. Navigate to the API section or search for specific modules, classes, functions, or methods using the search functionality provided.

## General Documentation

The general documentation section provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and any specific guidelines or instructions necessary for working with the codebase.

To access the general documentation:

1. Open the generated HTML documentation in a web browser.
2. Navigate to the general documentation section to find information about the project, its setup, usage, and any other relevant details.

## Contributing to the Documentation

Contributions to the documentation are welcome and encouraged. If you find any inaccuracies, missing information, or have suggestions for improvements, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.

2. Make the necessary updates to the documentation files.

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

4. Push your changes to your forked repository.

5. Open a pull request against the main repository, explaining the purpose and details of your changes.
