Here's a detailed guide on how to set up GitHub Actions for your team's ROS packages:

Step 1: Create a Workflow File
- In your GitHub repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
- Create a new file with a `.yml` extension, for example, `ros.yml`. This will be your workflow file.

Step 2: Define the Workflow
- Open the `ros.yml` file and add the following content to define the basic structure of the workflow:

```yaml
name: ROS Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Set up ROS
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Configure ROS
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential

          sudo rosdep init
          rosdep update
          echo "source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
          source ~/.bashrc

      - name: Set up catkin workspace
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
          cd ~/catkin_ws
          catkin init
          catkin config --extend /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

      - name: Build and Test
        run: |
          cd ~/catkin_ws
          catkin build
          source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
          catkin run_tests
```

This YAML configuration sets up a workflow named "ROS Build and Test" that runs on every push to the `main` branch and every pull request targeting the `main` branch. It defines a single job named "build-and-test" that runs on an Ubuntu environment.

Step 3: Customize ROS Workspace
- By default, the workflow sets up a basic catkin workspace. You can customize this section based on your specific ROS workspace structure.
- Update the `mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src` line to match your desired workspace directory structure if necessary.
- If your workspace already exists, you can remove the `mkdir` command and modify the subsequent commands to navigate to your existing workspace.

Step 4: Commit and Push
- Save the changes to your workflow file and commit it to your repository.
- Push the changes to trigger the workflow execution.

Step 5: View Workflow Results
- Once the workflow has been triggered, you can view the progress and results in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
- The workflow will run the defined steps, including setting up ROS, creating the catkin workspace, and building and testing the ROS packages.
- If any step fails, you will be notified, and you can investigate the issue by examining the logs.

That's it! You've set up GitHub Actions for building and testing your team's ROS packages. You can customize this basic configuration to include additional steps like code linting, code coverage, or deploying your packages to a robot, depending on your requirements. Make sure to adapt the workflow to your specific ROS workspace structure and dependencies.
