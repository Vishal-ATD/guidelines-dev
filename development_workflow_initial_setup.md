# Robotics Codebase Workflow

This guide outlines the workflow for maintaining a high-quality robotics codebase using GitHub and various tools. It covers everything from creating a repository to implementing Git hooks for automated checks. Following this workflow will help ensure consistent code quality, collaboration, and efficient development.

## Prerequisites

- **Git**: Install Git on your local machine. Refer to the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/) for installation instructions.
- **GitHub Account**: Create an account on GitHub. Visit [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up if you don't have an account yet.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the **"New"** button to create a new repository.
3. Provide a **Repository name** and an optional **Description**.
4. Choose whether to make the repository public or private, depending on your requirements.
5. Select the option to **"Initialize this repository with a README"**.
6. Click on the **"Create repository"** button.

### 2. Clone the Repository

1. On your local machine, open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. In the terminal, run the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo` with the name of your repository.

### 3. Set up Branching Strategy

1. Decide on a branching strategy suitable for your team (e.g., feature branches, pull requests).
2. Create a new branch for your work using the following command:
   ```
   git branch new-feature
   git checkout new-feature
   ```
   Replace `new-feature` with an appropriate branch name.

### 4. Develop and Commit Changes

1. Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor.
2. Make changes, add new files, or modify existing code according to your requirements.
3. Use the following commands to stage and commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```
   Replace `"Add new feature"` with a descriptive commit message.

### 5. Push Changes to GitHub

1. Push your committed changes to the remote repository using the following command:
   ```
   git push origin new-feature
   ```
   Replace `new-feature` with the name of your branch.

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Switch to the branch you just pushed by clicking on the branch dropdown.
3. Click on the **"New pull request"** button.
4. Provide a descriptive **Title** and **Description** for your pull request.
5. Review the changes and ensure they meet the required quality standards.
6. Click on the **"Create pull request"** button to submit the pull request.

### 7. Review, Merge, and Deploy

1. Other team members can review your changes in the pull request.
2. Address any feedback or suggestions provided during the review process.
3. Once the changes are approved, a project maintainer can merge the pull request into the main branch.
4. If applicable, set up a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline to automate the deployment of your robotics code.

## Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically before or after specific Git events. You can set up Git hooks to automate checks and actions in your repository. Here's how to set up a pre-commit hook as an example:

1. In your repository, navigate to the `.git/hooks` directory.
2. Create a new file named `pre-commit` (no file extension) in that directory.
3. Add the following code to the `pre-commit` file:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh

   # Run linters or tests before committing changes
   # Replace the following commands with your desired checks

   echo "Running linters..."
   lint_output=$(eslint .)
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "Linting failed. Please fix the errors before committing."
     echo "$lint_output"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "Running tests..."
   test_output=$(pytest)
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "Tests failed. Please fix the failures before committing."
     echo "$test_output"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```
   Customize the commands within the script to match your desired pre-commit checks.

4. Save the `pre-commit` file and make it executable by running the following command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

Now, whenever you try to make a commit, the pre-commit hook will automatically run the specified checks (e.g., linters, tests) and prevent the commit if any checks fail.
