# Tools used throughout the development process of the software system(not limited to)

1. **Version Control Workflow:**
   - Use Git as your version control system.
   - Set up a central repository, preferably on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
   - Create a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, pull requests) to facilitate collaborative development.

2. **Code Linter:**
   - Choose a linter appropriate for your programming language (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python).
   - Configure the linter with your preferred coding style guidelines.
   - Integrate the linter into your development environment or CI pipeline.
   - Run the linter regularly to enforce coding standards and catch potential errors.

3. **Unit Testing:**
   - Select a unit testing framework suitable for your language (e.g., pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript).
   - Write comprehensive unit tests to cover critical functionality.
   - Automate the execution of unit tests in your CI pipeline.
   - Ensure all tests pass before merging changes into the main branch.

4. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - Choose a CI service (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI, Jenkins) and integrate it with your repository.
   - Configure CI to trigger builds, run linters, and execute unit tests automatically on every push or pull request.
   - Set up a status check requirement, ensuring that all CI checks pass before merging changes.

5. **Static Code Analysis:**
   - Integrate static code analysis tools like SonarQube or CodeClimate into your CI pipeline.
   - Configure the analysis tools to scan your code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
   - Review the analysis results and address any identified issues to improve code quality.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Establish a documentation strategy for your project.
   - Utilize code comments and documentation tools (e.g., JSDoc, Sphinx) to generate documentation from your codebase.
   - Encourage team members to maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for new features and changes.

7. **Code Reviews:**
   - Encourage regular code reviews among team members.
   - Utilize pull requests and review features provided by your version control platform (e.g., GitHub pull requests).
   - Establish guidelines for code reviews, including expectations for reviewers and authors.
   - Address feedback and ensure that code changes meet quality standards before merging.

8. **Issue Tracking:**
   - Utilize an issue tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira) to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
   - Encourage team members to create and update issues for relevant topics.
   - Prioritize and assign issues to team members for resolution.
   - Link code changes and pull requests to associated issues to provide traceability.

9. **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
   - If applicable, set up a CD pipeline to automate deployment of your robotics code.
   - Configure CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, AWS CodeDeploy, GitLab CI/CD) to deploy code changes to your robots or robotic systems.
   - Integrate CD with your CI pipeline to ensure a seamless and automated workflow from code changes to deployment.

10. **Git Hooks:**
   - Set up Git hooks to automate actions or checks before or after specific Git events.
   - Use pre-commit hooks to run linters, tests, or other checks before committing changes.
   - Leverage post-commit hooks for additional tasks, such as triggering certain actions or notifications.

Regularly communicate and educate your team members about the workflow and its components. Ensure everyone understands the importance of maintaining high-quality code and actively participates in adhering to the established practices. Regularly review and iterate upon your workflow to incorporate feedback and improve efficiency.
