## Project Title and Description
Start your README.md file with a clear and concise project title that accurately represents the purpose of the ROS package. Follow it with a brief description or overview that highlights the package's main features and goals. This section helps users quickly understand what the package does.

Example:
```
# ROS Navigation Stack

The ROS Navigation Stack is a set of libraries and tools for enabling autonomous navigation of robots. It provides capabilities for map building, localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. With the Navigation Stack, robots can autonomously navigate through environments, avoiding obstacles and reaching specified goals.
```

## Installation
Include step-by-step instructions for installing the ROS package and any necessary dependencies. Specify the version of ROS required for the package and any additional system requirements. Provide any specific setup instructions or configuration parameters that need to be addressed. This section helps users get the package up and running quickly.

Example:
```
## Installation

### Prerequisites
- ROS Kinetic or newer
- Other package dependencies (list them here)

### Installation Steps
1. Create a new ROS workspace:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
   cd ~/catkin_ws/src
   catkin_init_workspace
   ```

2. Clone the ROS Navigation Stack repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation.git
   ```

3. Build the package and dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ~/catkin_ws
   catkin_make
   ```

4. Source the ROS environment:
   ```bash
   source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
   ```

Now, you can use the ROS Navigation Stack package in your ROS environment.
```

## Usage Instructions
Explain how to use the package, including how to launch the nodes, interact with the system, or perform specific tasks. Provide sample code or code snippets demonstrating common usage scenarios. Explain any required inputs or parameters and how to configure them. This section helps users understand how to utilize the package effectively.

Example:
```
## Usage Instructions

### Launching the Navigation Stack
To launch the ROS Navigation Stack, use the following command:
```bash
roslaunch navigation navigation.launch
```

### Setting Navigation Goals
To set a navigation goal for the robot, publish a `PoseStamped` message to the `/move_base_simple/goal` topic. For example, using `rostopic pub`:
```bash
rostopic pub /move_base_simple/goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp: {secs: 0, nsecs: 0}
  frame_id: 'map'
pose:
  position: {x: 2.0, y: 2.5, z: 0.0}
  orientation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}" 
```

Make sure to replace the `position` and `orientation` values with the desired coordinates.

### Customizing Parameters
To customize the navigation parameters, modify the `config` files located in the `params` directory. For example, `base_local_planner_params.yaml` contains parameters for the local planner algorithm. Edit the file according to your requirements.

```

## ROS Node and Topic Descriptions
If the package includes ROS nodes or publishes/subscribes to topics, provide descriptions for each node and topic. Explain the purpose and functionality of each node, including the messages it uses and the actions it performs. Describe the topics published and subscribed to by each node, along with the message types. This section helps users understand the underlying components and their interactions.

Example:
```
## ROS Node and Topic Descriptions

### Node: move_base
- **Description:** Implements the global and local planners for robot navigation.
- **Published Topics:**
  - `/move_base/status` (actionlib_msgs/GoalStatusArray): Publishes the status of the current navigation goal.
  - `/move_base/current_goal` (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped): Publishes the current navigation goal.
- **Subscribed Topics:**
  - `/map` (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid): Subscribes to the map for global planning.
  - `/scan` (sensor_msgs/LaserScan): Subscribes to the laser scan data for obstacle avoidance.

### Node: amcl
- **Description:** Provides adaptive Monte Carlo localization for the robot.
- **Published Topics:**
  - `/amcl_pose` (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped): Publishes the robot's estimated pose.
  - `/particlecloud` (geometry_msgs/PoseArray): Publishes the set of particles used for localization.
- **Subscribed Topics:**
  - `/map` (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid): Subscribes to the map for localization.
  - `/scan` (sensor_msgs/LaserScan): Subscribes to the laser scan data for localization.
```

## Package Architecture
If the package has a complex architecture, consider including a high-level overview or diagram explaining the different components and their interactions. Describe the relationships between nodes, packages, or other external systems. Provide any relevant information about the package's design choices or architectural patterns used. This section helps users grasp the overall structure and design of the package.

Example:
```
## Package Architecture

The ROS Navigation Stack consists of several components working together to provide autonomous navigation capabilities:

- **move_base:** This node combines global and local planners to guide the robot towards the goal while avoiding obstacles. It receives the global plan and laser scan data and outputs the velocity commands.
- **amcl:** The amcl node performs adaptive Monte Carlo localization based on the laser scan data and the map. It estimates the robot's pose and provides accurate localization information.
- **map_server:** This node provides the map data to other nodes in the stack. It loads the map from a file and publishes it as a `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid` message.
- **costmap_2d:** The costmap_2d node builds and maintains a 2D costmap representation of the environment. It receives data from the global planner and sensor sources and provides obstacle information for navigation.
- **local_planner:** This node generates velocity commands for the robot to achieve local navigation. It uses the local costmap, sensor data, and path information to generate smooth and collision-free

 trajectories.
```

## Configuration and Customization
Explain how to customize or configure the package for specific use cases or environments. Detail any configuration files or parameters that can be modified to adapt the package to different scenarios. Provide examples or guidelines for modifying the package's behavior. This section helps users tailor the package to their specific needs.

Example:
```
## Configuration and Customization

### Configuring the Global Planner
To customize the behavior of the global planner, modify the parameters in the `global_planner_params.yaml` file. You can adjust parameters related to path planning algorithms, goal tolerance, and more. Experiment with different values to optimize the planner's performance for your robot and environment.

### Adapting the Local Costmap
The local costmap behavior can be adjusted by modifying the parameters in the `local_costmap_params.yaml` file. You can fine-tune parameters such as obstacle inflation radius, update frequency, or sensor characteristics to match the specific needs of your robot.

Refer to the respective parameter files within the package for more details on customization options.
